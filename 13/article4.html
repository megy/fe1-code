									<h3><strong class="title">5 Tips: Create Mobile Friendly Landing Pages</strong></h3>				
									<span class="meta"><strong>August 14, 2012</strong></span><br>
									<span class="copy"><strong>by Corina Ciripitca</strong>  </span>
									<p class="first">With the always spinning technologies, the latest trend in web development today is to go mobile.Since smartphones and tablets began to run the technologies markets, websites and applications are now customized to go both with desktop computers as well as to have a mobile version. People started to understand the comfort of using a mobile device in order to access their favorite websites or simply "surf the web". </p>
									<p>The only problem today is to decide what phone or tablet you would like to buy with the multitude of options there are on the market. However another important thing, especially for website owners is to deliver their business or message to any screen size possible in order to reach a bigger audience. The first thing a user sees when reaching your website is your landing page. Now once you are doing it from a bigger screen on your desktop computer it looks fine - adding interesting design elements is essential. However when you do it from a small screen, all those details might seem overwhelming and confusing. Keeping it simple might be the rule you would have to follow in the first place. Once a user lands on your website from a mobile phone or tablet, you would have to provide only the necessary stuff so that he could easily get exactly what he needs. I browsed the net and found some tips you might want to follow when working on your landing page meant for mobile devices.</p>
									<h4>Tip Nr. 1</h4>
									<h5>Follow the "KISS" principle</h5>
									<p>One thing you wouldn't want to do is confuse your visitors right? Make sure to keep your landing page as simple as possible, without overcrowding it with unnecessary information that will be useless in the end. Mobile devices obviously have smaller screens, hence the most important information should be displayed once the user lands on your website. </p>
									<p>Make sure for the landing page to look as simple as possible. It has to convey the information you think your users are looking for.</p>
									<h4>Tip Nr. 2</h4>
									<h5>Speed Optimization is Important</h5>
									<p>Pages have to load quickly no matter the screen size. Mobile users are less likely to wait for a certain page to load. Besides having an impact on the revenue, as visitors abandon the website once they see page load is too slow, it also affects Google Page Rank, as well as other search engines. Research shows that only 11% of all the mobile users accept delays, while 58% are impatient towards slow page loads. There are a bunch of tools you might use to convert your pages to a mobile version. You can also learn some tips and tricks on the web on how to optimize pages for mobile versions.</p>
									<h4>Tip Nr. 3</h4>
									<h5>Avoid Using Flash</h5>
									<p>It is usually not recommendable to use Flash for mobile version websites. However if you still decided it is important for you to use Flash, you would have to optimize if for the mobile device. Here is what Adobe has to say about it for instance: "Make your Flash enabled web content device-friendly by taking into consideration the following three factors: Performance: Smartphones and tablets have fewer hardware resources than desktop computers today—less RAM, CPU power, GPU resources, etc. </p>
									<p>Screen size: The physical size and resolution limit the amount of information that can be displayed at one time. Interaction: The application user interface should anticipate touch-based input, accelerometers, screen orientation, etc. and shouldn't assume the presence of a physical keyboard or mouse. "</p>
									<h4>Tip Nr. 4</h4>
									<h5>Page Optimizations Should Be Taken Seriously</h5>
									<p>Scrolling down and up again is important. It is user friendly and people are used to it. Hence think about then when thinking about including horizontal scrolling options. Keep in mind that URL's should be kept short (about 40 characters). This way you can ensure users remember it and retype them later on when they want to check something on your website. </p>
									<p>Don't forget to maintain page titles simple and short. Otherwise they will look weird on smaller screens, even though they will be optimized. People would have to zoom out or zoom in in order to see what</p>
									<h4>Tip Nr. 5</h4>
									<h5>Extend Your Brand</h5>
									<p>The last but not least important thing to consider is that you should still keep the nice design rule in your mind while having your mobile version of the website done. The mobile version, whether it's a full website or an app should be an extension of your brand. So keeping the same design and colors is essential. Some people might access your website and relate to it only through a mobile device, hence keeping your brand visible is a must. Details might become essential elements in your mobile version, or vice-versa. </p>
									<p>he important thing is to be sure you included all the information you wanted in your website whether we are talking about desktop screens or small smartphones. Please do share some other tips you think might help users get some awesome landing pages for mobile version websites.</p>

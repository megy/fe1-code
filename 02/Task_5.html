	<h1>Amsterdam</h1>
	<h2>History</h2>
	<hr />
	<h3>Etymology</h3>
	<p>The earliest recorded use of the name "Amsterdam" is from a certificate dated 
	27 October 1275, when the inhabitants, who had built a bridge with a dam across 
	the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstelhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstel">Amstel</a>, 
	were exempted from paying a bridge toll by Count Floris V.[16][unreliabl1 source?] 
	The certificate describes the inhabitants as homines manentes apud Amestelledamme 
	(people living near Amestelledamme).[17] By 1327, the name had developed into Aemsterdam.[16]</p>
	<h3>Founding and Middle Ages</h3>
	<p>Amsterdam's founding is relatively recent compared with much older Dutch cities such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nijmegenhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nijmegen">Nijmegen</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdamhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrechthttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht">Utrecht</a>. In October 2008, historical geographer Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed as early as the late 10th century. This does not necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then since reclamation of land may not have been for farming—it may have been for peat, used as fuel.[18]</p>
	<h3>Conflict with Spain</h3>n the 16th century, the Dutch rebelled against Philip II of Spain and his successors. The main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the religious persecution of Protestants by the Spanish Inquisition. The revolt escalated into the Eighty Years' War, which ultimately led to Dutch independence.[21] Strongly pushed by Dutch Revolt leader William the Silent, the Dutch Republic became known for its relative religious tolerance. Jews from the Iberian Peninsula, Huguenots from France, prosperous merchants and printers from Flanders, and economic and religious refugees from the Spanish-controlled parts of the Low Countries found safety in Amsterdam. The influx of Flemish printers and the city's intellectual tolerance made Amsterdam a centre for the European free press.<sup>[22]</sup>
